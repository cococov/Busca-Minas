### Description

---

My first (programming) personal project.
The game is basicaly a matrix that have a code in every cell:

| cÃ³digo  |    significado   |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 0  | no mine and not clicked |
| 1  | one mine nearby  |
| 2  | two mines nearby  |
| 3  | three mines nearby  |
| 4  | four mines nearby  |
| 5  | five mines nearby  |
| 6  | six mines nearby  |
| 7  | seven mines nearby  |
| 8  | eight mines nearby  |
| 9  | mine and not clicked |
| 10 | no mine and clicked |
| 11 | mine and clicked |
| 12 | no mine and flag |
| 13 | mine and flag |
| 14 | mine and lose |

To represent the matrix at the GUI, I use the ``canvas`` of ``java`` and ``java swing`` for the ``UI`` of the game.
For the images I used ``paint``.

## TODO ðŸš€
- Rewrite the entire game, using my current knowledge and good practices.
